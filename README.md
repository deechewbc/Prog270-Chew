============

Places I have travelled:
* Dubai
* Tanzania
	*Safari in the desert
* Israel
* Jordan
* Egypt

My **favorite** place in the world is Safari.

'''
Safari was special because of the animals running in the wild.  I was up close to an elephant.  Saw a giraffe stretch his neck to eat food.  The scariest moment came when we spotted a cheetah.  All the animals froze.
