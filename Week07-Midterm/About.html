<h1>Historical Event</h1>

<p>There are many historical things in our lives.  Mine is going to a safari and seeing animals that are normally caged but walking or running free.  I had the opportunity of seeing a male and female lion.</p>

<p>What is so historical about a <strong>male</strong> lion?  Think about these three facts: <br />
1.  The mane <br />
2.  Eyes <br />
3.  Roar  </p>

<p>What other animal in the universe has this mane. This mane in my opinion makes lion <em>The king of the jungle</em>.  At first glance I want to run my fingers through the mane because it looks so soft.</p>

<p>Now lets think about the <strong>female</strong> lion.  Is it as fierce looking as the male lion?</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Female_lion.jpg/393px-Female_lion.jpg" alt=Araguanei" title" /></p>

<p>Lets think of 3 historical events about the <strong>female</strong> lion? <br />
1.  Hunt together with other female lions <br />
2.  Prefer male lions with bigger and darker mane <br />
3.  Protect male lions during fights</p>

<p>During my safari we had the opportunity to see male and female lion with their cubs.  The cubs were playing with the female lion as the male watched.  I got the sense he was busy protecting his family.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how lions communicate?  I cant imagine the male lion roaring all night and day at the female or the cubs.  I asked this question to my safari guide.  Surprise surprise they communicate by their <strong>EARS</strong>.  Who would have guessed.  So every couple of seconds I would see the male move his ears as well as the female.  It is fascinating to watch communication without sound. </p>

<p>Next time in the zoo check out the male lion's ears.  How often does it twitch or move.</p>
